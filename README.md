# machine-learning-fun
This my github portfolio of the all the cool things I do with machine learning.

Each folder has its own readme.md explaining what's going on.

The first commits to this repo are from Jose Portilla's Complete Guide to TensorFlow for Deep Learning with Python. I plan to branch out into other databases.

I eventually want to run some models on Star Wars Destiny the card and dice game - see my other repo for that.
